### Our paper has been accepted by ISBI 2024!
## Proposed method
We spend a lot of time collecting and summarizing relevant papers and datasets, where you can find them at https://github.com/Ivygugu/Pulmonary-Embolism-Detection/blob/main/README.md

This code is a pytorch implementation of our paper "PE-MVCNET: MULTI-VIEW AND CROSS-MODAL FUSION NETWORK FOR PULMONARY EMBOLISM PREDICTION".

 Our method comprises the Image-only module with an integrated multi-view block, the EMR-only module, and the Cross-modal Attention Fusion (CMAF) module. These modules cooperate to extract comprehensive features that subsequently generate predictions for PE. The figure below shows our proposed network.
